    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> We all love a good bowl of Tom Yam soup. It’s spicy, sour, and savoury all at once, creating an exciting and satisfying taste sensation. Get the same flavours with a one-pot rice cooker! </p>
    <p> Making this Tom Yam Chicken Rice in a rice cooker simplifies the cooking process by allowing you to prepare everything in one pot. 
        Add the rice, liquid, protein, vegetables, and seasonings all at once, minimising the need for multiple pots and pans.</p>
    <p> Once you’ve added all the ingredients to the rice cooker, you can simply set it and forget it. 
        The rice cooker will take care of the rest, cooking the rice and infusing it with the flavours of the other ingredients. 
        This hands-off approach saves time and effort in the kitchen.</p>
